Processing
==========
A collection of sketches using various libraries I use during courses.  

## Forms
* **Chladni plate interference surfaces**
* **L_System**
* **Turmites** - according to wikipedia, a turmite is a Turing machine which has an orientation as well as a current state and a "tape" that consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells.
* **Sunflower**
* **Torus** - made with Processing 1.5.1.
* **RuttEtra**
* **MazeGenerator** - using recursive backtracker algorithm.
* **Circles**
* **HilbertCurve**
* **Penrose**
* **Langton ant**
* **Cellular automaton with rule 30 and 110**

## Animation
* **OmbroCinema**

## Data
* **SimpleMapAppOpenPaths** - example on how to use Unfolding Maps library for plotting geo positions retrieved from https://openpaths.cc in real time.
Using the new data capabilities of Processing 2 (JSON stuff)
  
* **SimpleMapAppOpenPathsCSV** - example on how to use Unfolding Maps for plotting geo positions and Ani to track those positions over time retrieved from csv data downloaded from your account on https://openpaths.cc. 
This example does not take into account «real speed» between points


## Communication
* **CanvasOSC** - example on how to draw on canvas from another computer
* **CanvasOSCClient**

## Image
* **CameraPropagation**
* **CameraSlitScanVertical**
